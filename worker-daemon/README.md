# SPworkerTemp
Temporary repository to ease the worker daemon setup

## Installation instructions (internal)

## Depedencies

* This assumes a worker OS is Ubuntu 20.04
* Install Kafka 2.13-3.1.0 currently
* ROS components on worker too - all ROS components

```
sudo apt-get install python-is-python3 python3-venv python3-pip maven openjdk-11-jdk openjdk-17-jdk
docker run hello-world # - verify docker works as normal user

```

If Docker is not working as your user, check socket permissions and then try again
(may have to log out and in again, or reboot)

### Set up the SESAME code (distributed branch)

The SESAME code is needed to process and run the test runners:

```
mkdir ~/academic/sesame
git clone https://github.com/sesame-project/simulationBasedTesting
cd simulationBasedTesting
git checkout distributed-expt
```

Need to install the mvn arctifacts for the project from SESAME code:

```
cd ~/academic/sesame/simulationBasedTesting/uk.ac.york.sesame.testing.architecture
mvn install
cd ~/academic/sesame/simulationBasedTesting/jrosbridge
mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true
# mvn install -DskipTests
# If it still runs tests, do Ctrl-C
cd ~/academic/sesame/simulationBasedTesting/uk.ac.york.sesame.testing.architecture.ros
mvn install
cd ~/academic/sesame/simulationBasedTesting/uk.ac.york.sesame.testing.dsl
mvn install
cd ~/academic/sesame/simulationBasedTesintg/jgea
mvn install
cd ~/academic/sesame/simulationBasedTesting/uk.ac.york.sesame.testing.evolutionary
mvn install
```

### Checkout the worker daemon from this repo

```
mkdir ~/academic/soprano
Checkout this repo for the daemon here
```

### Setup a virtualenv for needed Python packages and install daemon

```
python -m venv ~/academic/pyro
. ~/academic/pyro/bin/activate
pip install pyro5 pyinstaller netifaces structlog docker

cd ~/academic/soprano/REPO
pyinstaller daemon.py
```

### Setup an SSH key and copy to experiment manager
This is needed to synchronize the generated code with the experiment manager
The below command copies the key onto the Docker container for the experiment manager...

This assumes the SSH server is on the default (SOPRANO alternative) port of 39222
It will be if using the Docker for the experiment manager, if not, just use
22 and your standard username on the experiment manager PC.

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -p 39222 simtesting@expt_manager_ip
```

The default password will be "simtesting", unless changed during
experiment manager Docker setup.

Test that you can log properly into the experiment manager Docker as recommended by
ssh-copy-id. After doing this, it is recommended that you set "PasswordAuthentication no"
in /etc/ssh/sshd_config inside the experiment manager Docker.


### Before running experiment (PAL example)
The Pyro nameserver is now set up on the experiment runner, not on a worker.
It must be started first.

* Set up PAL from the containers
* Ensure PAL experiment script present at the start up location specified in the DSL model.
* Ensure Kafka/Zookeeper started
* Enter the virtualenv with the activate script

Start up daemon with expt runnner IP and port:
```
cd ~/academic/soprano/REPO
./dist/daemon/daemon --expt_runner_ip=192.168.1.28 --expt_runner_user=jharbin
```

NB. The daemon needs to be run under the dist directory from
pyinstaller; because otherwise e.g. if it is run by e.g. "python3 ./daemon.py", it will be
killed during the terminate script after a particular test!

* Ensure the IP of the experiment runner is set up in the model
