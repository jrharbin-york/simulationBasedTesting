:END:

* TODO Remaining hardcoded items:
** TODO The PYRO_NS_HOSTNAME in rosMain.egl - needs to be set from the DSL - get from current expt runner IP
** TODO NS_HOSTNAME in PyroDaemons.java - in distributed package - again needs to be set in expt runner
** TODO there is still a hardcoded hostname in evolutionary.distributed/PyroDaemons.java
** TODO terminate.egl should not terminate all Docker containers if there is no Docker used - otherwise this kills a local experiment runner in a container
*** terminate.egl would need to know the container names to kill
** TODO configurable Kafka path on the workers in clear_kafka.egl
** TODO configurable path for the JVM? - at the moment it is hardcoded in compile.egl and execute.egl

* TODO Status monitor
** TODO stop() is never called for RemoteStatusMonitor - it should call it itself, once COMPELTED or FAILED is registered

* TODO Model validation improvements needed
** TODO with no metrics in the model, the generated code is invalid!
** TODO check that every operation has a name entered
** TODO every stream metric must have IN stream, or code is invalid
** TODO every campaign must have metrics, or code is invalid
** TODO has an EVL script for validating the model operations

* TODO Genetic algorithm
** TODO Handling GA with different types of operations
** TODO For operation reductions - reduction to single point should be handled in the DSL

* Enhacements
** Find the current IP and start the nameserver on the node
** Need to start up the nameserver and find the current IP address in Java instead
** TODO Ordering; process tests in order!
** TODO for heterogenous - do not pre-allocate more than 1
** TODO allocation wait in allocationLoop() in SOPRANOExperimentManager - ideally no wait

* Repeated execution
** DONE * TODO: RepeatedExection currently not working with distributed runner - evaluate() method needs to be rewritten
** TODO when running a RepeatedExectionTest - need to ensure all the previous results are cleared - otherwise, setting up the MetricConsumers will fail with INVALID_CAMPAIGN
*** This can be fixed by attaching a unique name to the generated tests

* Parameter settings
** Code generation fixes needed for ETERRY
